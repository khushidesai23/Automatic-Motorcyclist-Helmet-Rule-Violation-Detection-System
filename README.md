# Automatic-Motorcyclist-Helmet-Rule-Violation-Detection-System
This system employs the power of the YOLOv5 deep learning framework for real-time detection of motorcyclists without helmets. Simultaneously capturing vehicle number plates, it offers law enforcement a robust tool for enforcing helmet laws effectively. By leveraging YOLOv5's speed and accuracy in object detection, this project showcases innovative use of deep learning technology for public safety.

Key Points:

-Problem Statement: Road traffic injuries, particularly involving motorcyclists, are a leading cause of death globally. Compliance with helmet laws is inconsistent.

-Solution Overview: The Automatic Motorcyclist Helmet Rule Violation Detection system uses the YOLOv5 model to detect violations in real-time and capture vehicle number plates.

-Benefits: Automation reduces reliance on manual monitoring, ensuring more consistent and unbiased enforcement. Real-time functionality allows immediate action against violators, potentially deterring future non-compliance.

-Technological Integration: The system combines advanced deep learning techniques with optical character recognition (OCR) technology, specifically integrating YOLOv5 and EasyOCR for high accuracy and efficiency in real-time detection.
